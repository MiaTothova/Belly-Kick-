## UX
I aimed to create a simple blog app aimed at pregnant moms and dads or people trying to concieve.

#### The ideal client:
* Adults
* Parents
* English Speaking
* Anyone looking to educate themselves.
* Women 
* Men

### The website will help clients to:
* Navigate easily through the website
* View content of interest
* Sign up / login
* Contact admin
* Comment, like and share the content wih people of interest.




### User Stories
1. As a Site User I can view a paginated list of posts so that select a post to view.


2. As a Site User I can view a list of posts so that I can select one to read.
* On the main blog page, the viewer can view posts that have been posted to the blog by an admin. The user can then decide which post to read.

3. As a Site User I can click on a post so that I can read the full text.
* The user can click on any published post to read it.

4. As a Site User / Admin I can view the number of likes on each post so that I can see which is the most popular. or viral.
* Both the user (logged in or not) and the admin can see how many likes have been given to any published post.

5. As a Site User / Admin I can view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation.
* Both the user and the admin can view comments that have been left on a post. 

6. As a Site User I can register an account so that I can comment and like.
* In the navigation bar, I have a Register link which brings the user to the registration form. After completing registration the user can then comment and like posts.

7. As a Site User I can leave comments on a post so that I can be involved in the conversation.
* This can be achieved after registering/loggig in.

8. As a Site User I can like or unlike a post so that I can interact with the content.
* * This can be achieved after registering/loggig in.

9. As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my blog content.
* All of this is fully functioning. The admin has a full power over the app.

10. As a Site Admin I can create draft posts so that I can finish writing the content later.
* All of this can be achieved via the admin panel.

11. As a Site Admin I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments.
* All of this can be done via the admin panel. After a user submits a comment, it then needs to aproved by the admin before it shows up on the blog post.

12. As a user I can fill out a form so that the page admin can contact me.
* After clicking the Contact us button on the main page. The user then fills out the contact form and it sends the users information the the admin pannel. The admin then can view the contact details and the message, and can contact the user accordingly.

### The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features my website:

1. Main blog page.  
2. Fully functioning navigation bar and footer to navigate through the site.
3. Contact us button featured on the main page, for anyone wanting to contact the admin.
4. Register page, where people can sign up and create a username in order to acces the commenting and likes functionalities.
5. Login page 
6. contact us page, which gets accesed through the main page and includes a form.
7. Sign out link.

### The skeleton
The blog application consists of 5 pages in total including the signout link.
Here are just rough wireframes :
